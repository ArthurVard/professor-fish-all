== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:csc.exe]]: C# compiler (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:.NET]]: framework used to execute compiled code (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:NUnit]]: unit testing framework used for testing (Version 2.5)
* [[Technology:Visual Studio]]: optional IDE (Version 2010)

* [[101feature:Depth]]

== Motivation ==

== Illustration ==

To set up routes we need to implement class derived from System.Web.HttpApplication

<syntaxhighlight lang=csharp>
public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication
</syntaxhighlight>

There is a method which executed 

<syntaxhighlight lang=csharp>
protected void Application_Start()
{
  .....
  RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
}
</syntaxhighlight>


Usually there is a need to force MVC to ignore some resources:

<syntaxhighlight lang=csharp>
routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");
</syntaxhighlight>


To map routes on controller's actions, the following method is used:
<syntaxhighlight lang=csharp>
 routes.MapRoute(
                "Default", // Route name
                "{controller}/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters
                new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = UrlParameter.Optional } // Parameter defaults
             );
</syntaxhighlight>

Default engine would search for the following locations:

* ~/Views/Home/Index.aspx
* ~/Views/Home/Index.ascx
* ~/Views/Shared/Index.aspx
* ~/Views/Shared/Index.ascx
* ~/Views/Home/Index.cshtml
* ~/Views/Home/Index.vbhtml
* ~/Views/Shared/Index.cshtml
* ~/Views/Shared/Index.vbhtml

== Architecture ==

C# object-oriented representation of 101companies model is located in
the ''CompanyModel folder''. It contains classes with required
properties and methods (features implementations).

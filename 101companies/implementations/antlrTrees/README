== Intent ==

parsing textual syntax with [[Technology:ANTLR]]

== Status ==

[[101status:Featured]]

== Motivation ==

Both concrete and abstract syntax is defined for companies.
To this end, we use an ANTLR-based parser description.
The resulting context-free parsing implements [[101feature:Import]].
The abstract syntax is based on ANTLR's homogeneous tree format.
A constructed tree can be walked with an ANTLR tree grammar to total all salaries or to cut salaries in half.

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]

* [[101profile:Java CLI]]

== Usage ==

See [[101implementation:antlrAcceptor]] for general instructions on the usage of ANTLR-based implementations.

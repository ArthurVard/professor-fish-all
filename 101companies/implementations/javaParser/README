== Intent ==

recursive-descent parsing in [[Language:Java]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[101profile:Simple Java]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Import]]
* [[101feature:Export]]

== Motivation ==

Recursive-descent parsing is used to process a text-based representation of companies.
The underlying lexer is custom-made, too.
Both lexer and parser use a lookahead of 1.
The lexer reports all tokens excluding whitespace.
The parser relies on protected handler methods to allow for injection of semantic actions.
For instance, [[101feature:Total]] is implemented by defining the handler for employees to aggregate salaries.
The implementation of [[101feature:Cut]] requires ad hoc pretty printing.
Such a combination of parsing and pretty printing implements [[101feature:Import]] and [[101feature:Export]].

== Architecture ==

Package ''org.softlang.parser'' hosts all components for parsing: a lexer, an enum type for tokens,
and a parser that can be customized with semantic actions by class inheritance. (The lexer is essentially c
opied from [[101implementation:javaLexer]] except that whitespace is skipped.) Package 
''org.softlang.operations'' hosts implementations of [[101feature:Total]] and [[101feature:Cut]].
Package ''org.softlang.tests'' hosts JUnit tests; see below.

== Usage ==

* The implementation is provided as an Eclipse project. 
* Hence, open the project with Eclipse; this will also build the project.
* There are JUnit tests available in the package ''org.softlang.tests''.
** Run class ''Operations'' with JUnit to exercise basic operations.
** Run class ''Noop'' with JUnit to exercise positive and negative test cases for the parser.

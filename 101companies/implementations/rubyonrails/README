== Intent ==

[[Web programming]]  in [[Language:Ruby]] with [[Technology:Ruby on Rails]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Ruby]]
* [[Language:JavaScript]]
* [[Language:HTML]]
* [[Language:CSS]]

== Technologies == 

* [[Technology:Ruby on Rails]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Client/server]]
* [[101feature:Attribute editing]]
* [[101feature:Structural editing]]

== Motivation ==

We exercise [[Web programming]] using [[Technology:Ruby on Rails]]. That is, we use this MVC web application framework to provide  [[101feature:Attribute editing|attribute]] and [[101feature:Structural editing|structural editing]] of companies by using a dynamically typed language. 

== Illustration ==

Most of the implementations code was generated using the ''rails generate scaffold'' command. This generates 
* A model for the given class and attributes
* A view including pages for editing, indexing and showing instances
* A controller for actions like creating, updating and removing of instances

=== Routes ===

The ''routes.rb'' file defines a default route when entering the application:

<syntaxhighlight lang="ruby>
get "home/index"
</syntaxhighlight>

That is when entering by just providing the host:port information the user is redirected to this page.

This file also defines ruby resources:

<syntaxhighlight lang="ruby">
resources :employees

resources :departments do
  resources :departments
  resources :employees
end 

resources :companies do
  resources :departments
end
</syntaxhighlight>

These rules define what kind of resources the application contains and which nesting should be applied. For instance, a company has many department resources.

The framework also provides routes for both index pages and pages for showing a concrete instance. For companies these helpers are provided:
* <syntaxhighlight lang="ruby" enclose="none">companies_path</syntaxhighligth> provides the URL for the index page for all companies.
* <syntaxhighlight lang="ruby" enclose="none">company_path(someCompany)</syntaxhighligth> provides the URL for the given company.

This example shows the use of pluralisation for name conventions.

=== Model ===






== Usage ==

* Run ''rails s'' in the project's root folder.
* Run ''rake db:migrate'' in the project's root folder

== Intent ==

[[web programming]] with [[Language:PHP]] and the [[Technology:Zend framework]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:PHP]]
* [[Language:HTML]]
* [[Language:CSS]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Zend framework]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]
* [[101feature:Persistence]]
* [[101feature:Precedence]]
* [[101feature:Validation]]

== Motivation ==

[[Language:PHP]] is one of the most common [[:Category:Language|languages]] for [[web programming]]. To get a more structured and valuable [[:Category:101implementation|implementation]], it is reasonable to choose a [[Language:PHP]] based [[:Category:web-application framework]]. The [[Technology:Zend framework]] provides a good infrastructure and a large amount of pre-assembled components.

== Architecture ==



== Usage ==

* Download the implementation from the svn
* Install [[Technology:NetBeans]] (http://netbeans.org/)

This project needs a running [[Technology:MySQL]]-database. We recommend [[Technology:XAMPP]].
You can use the ''company.sql'' and ''sampleCompany.sql'' of [[101implementation:mySql]] for this project.

* Download and install [[Technology:XAMPP]]
* Open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
* Use the guideline of [[101implementation:mySql]] up to "Populate tables..."

After the database is started:

* Start [[Technology:NetBeans]]
* Open the Zend project: right-click on the ''projects''-table in NetBeans and then left-click on ''Open Projects''
* Import the zend project out of the file system
* Start the implementation with a click on the ''run''-Button. A [[:Category:Webbrowser|browser]]-window will open automatically.

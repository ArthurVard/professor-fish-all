== Intent ==

[[web programming]] with [[Language:PHP]] and the [[Technology:Zend framework]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:PHP]]
* [[Language:HTML]]
* [[Language:CSS]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:Zend framework]]

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Interaction]]
* [[101feature:Persistence]]
* [[101feature:Precedence]]
* [[101feature:Validation]]

== Motivation ==

[[Language:PHP]] is one of the most common [[:Category:Language|languages]] for [[web programming]]. To get a more structured and valuable [[:Category:101implementation|implementation]], it is reasonable to choose a [[Language:PHP]] based [[:Category:web-application framework]]. The [[Technology:Zend framework]] provides a good infrastructure and a large amount of pre-assembled components.

== Illustration ==

The features [[101feature:Total]] and [[101feature:Cut]] are both implemented in the [this!!application/models/DbTable/Employee.php models/dbTables/Employee.php]-[[Model View Controller|model]]. The reason is, that these methods affect only employees, depend on the corresponding company or department. The automatic detection for the right data-table, provided by the variable ''$_name'' in the specific model, offers a simple structuring of the methods:

<syntaxhighlight lang="php" source="zend/application/models/DbTable/Employee.php" line>
protected $_name = 'employee';

...

public function getTotalForCompany($id) {
    $id = (int)$id;
    $rows = $this->fetchAll('cid = ' . $id);
    $total = 0;
    foreach ($rows as $row) {
        $total += $row->salary;
    }
    return $total;
}
</syntaxhighlight>

This method returns the total-value for a company with a given ''$id''.

[[:Category:Client]]-side can be easily implemented into the forms (e.g. [this!!application/forms/Employee.php forms/Employee.php]): [TODO]

== Architecture ==



== Usage ==

* Download the implementation from the svn
* Install [[Technology:NetBeans]] (http://netbeans.org/)

This project needs a running [[Technology:MySQL]]-database. We recommend [[Technology:XAMPP]].
You can use the ''company.sql'' and ''sampleCompany.sql'' of [[101implementation:mySql]] for this project.

* Download and install [[Technology:XAMPP]]
* Open the "XAMPP Control Panel" and start "Apache" and "MySQL"
* Use the guideline of [[101implementation:mySql]] up to "Populate tables..."

After the database has started:

* Start [[Technology:NetBeans]]
* Open the Zend project: right-click on the ''projects''-table in NetBeans and then left-click on ''Open Projects''
* Import the zend project out of the file system
* Start the implementation with a click on the ''run''-Button. A [[:Category:Webbrowser|browser]]-window will open automatically.

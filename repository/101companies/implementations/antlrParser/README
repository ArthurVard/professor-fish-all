== Intent ==

parsing textual syntax with [[Technology:ANTLR]]

== Motivation ==

An ANTLR-based parser for a concrete syntax of companies is provided. The underlying grammar is LL(1). The parser uses semantics actions to implement [[101feature:Total]]. Such parsing implements [[101feature:Import]].

* [[101feature:Import]] 

== Languages ==

* [[Language:Java]]

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:ANTLR]] (Version 3.2)
* [[101profile:Java CLI]]

== Architecture ==

See [[101implementation:antlrAcceptor]] for general instructions on the architecture of ANTLR-based implementations.

== Usage ==

See [[101implementation:antlrAcceptor]] for general instructions on the usage of ANTLR-based implementations.

[[Category:XML theme]]

== Intent ==

[[pull-based XML parsing]] in [[Language:CSharp|C#]] with [[Technology:XmlReader]]

== Languages ==

* [[Language:CSharp]](C#): Programming language used for all code (Version 4.0)

== Technologies ==

* [[Technology:csc.exe]]: C# compiler (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:.NET]]: Framework used to execute compiled code (Version 4.0)
* [[Technology:NUnit]]: Unit testing framework used for testing (Version 2.5)

== Features ==

* [[101feature:Company]]
* [[101feature:Total]]
* [[101feature:Cut]]
* [[101feature:Depth]]
* [[101feature:Import/Export]]

== Motivation ==

[[:Category:XML processing]] with XmlReader which provides a lower-level abstraction over the XML file structure. This implementation retains more complexity than other solutions (e.g. [[101implementation:csharpLinqToXml]]) but benefits performance.

== Architecture ==

For totaling salaries we read XML file and check for "Salary" nodes.
For cutting, we go through the source XML file in a streaming fashion (by using Read() method of XmlReader which reads a current line of an input XML stream and goes to the next one) and write the content as-is into an output string. We maintain a valid XML structure, even temporary it is represented as a string type. Every time we reach the "Salary" node, we read the content (which is the actual salary) as a decimal number, cut it, and write into an output string.
When the end of the source file is reached, we use XmlTextWriter to produce a new XML file from the raw XML content in a string variable.

== Usage ==

[[Technology:Visual Studio]] 2010 should be used to open a project file.
The project itself is a class-library and compiles into a DLL. To run a project you must execute at least one unit test (or all at once).
Nunit GUI or other Visual studio extension (e.g. Resharper) should be used for executing unit tests.

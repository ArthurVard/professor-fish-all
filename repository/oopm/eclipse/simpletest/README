Several Eclipse projects documenting a simple approach to testing.

- gcdImplNaive: naive testing using the "println/main method"
- gcdImplMono: automatic testing with assertions
- gcdImplSub: variation on gcdImplMono with extra class for tests
- gcdImplMod: variation on gcdImplSub with different implementation
- gcdImplNone: incomplete (missing) implementation
- gcdImplFake: illustration of cheating by test-case encoding
- gcdImplClone: illustration of cheating by cloning

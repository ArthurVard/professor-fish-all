A few implementations of the factorial function.
These variations demonstrate structured programming and goto elimination.

Description of the variants
* goto1.c: variant with 2 gotos giving rise to spaghetti code
* goto2.c: variant with a simple goto suggesting a while loop directly
* nogoto1.c: goto1.c after general goto elimination (BÃ¶hm-Jacopini theorem)
* nogoto2.c: goto2.c after converting simple goto-based loop into while loop
* switch.c: variation of nogoto1.c to use switch instead of if
